## contributing
You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; I am always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do my best to process them as fast as I can.

Before you start to code, I recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
